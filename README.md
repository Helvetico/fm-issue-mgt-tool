# fm-issue-mgt-tool
Tool for facility management service provider to track and resolve reported issues.  

To bring our fm-service firm to the next level I need a tool to manage issues raised by either my staff on tour (cleaning, mowing, small maintenance and repair work etc.) or tenants living in the appartments. 

I believe it needs to be an app with a simple user interface that can be downloaded, but I dont know how I should start... I found the tool balsamiq - should I just sketch my idea with balsamiq and link it here in order you can have a look at? What approach is best to get there? 

Thanks for advice - Thomas.
